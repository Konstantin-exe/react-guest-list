# CORONA PARTY GUEST LIST

Are you sick of not knowing whom of your fellow conspiracy theoriest will come to the next hot anti-corona demo in your town?
SAY NO MORE: with the _CORONA PARTY GUEST LIST_ you will be able to organize all the participants in just one web application.

FROM NOW ON YOU WILL ALWAYS KNOW HOW MUCH Q-APPLE JUICE YOU NEED TO PREPARE!

# USAGE

Use the Input-Fields to give your participants a "First- " and "Last Name" and press "Submit" to create an Demo-Card.
With the "Filter" selection menu you will be able to filter your fellow theoriest between the proud boys who will show up at the event and the guys who will stay at home being active on social media.

Just press the "Is attending" checkbox in order to mark a participant as attending.

If one of your lads (for some unknown reason) will start to believe in the mainstream media and will get vaccinated, you can press the black "Vaccinated" button to immediately erase this person from your life... erm... list!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
